  <p>Welcome to Track Star, a game where you have the potential to be a world class runner competing for that gold medal spot on the podium. However in order to earn that spot, you will have to prove your talent. That takes being the best at every level. Start as an ameteur and win your first race. That will move you to the next level: the olympic qualifiers! Win that, and you are on your way to the OLYMPICS! Each race will be ran as the player draws a card from the top of the deck by clicking it, and whatever the card says is the move that takes place! Have fun and run fast! See you at the ceremonies! </p>
